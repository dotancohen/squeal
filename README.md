======

Database explorer with a focus on breadth, not depth.

FAQ
===

Why do we need yet another database explorer?
---------------------------------------------

All of today's well-developed database explorers make it easy to do the things that are already easy to do in SQL, namely to dig down to the details of a single table's rows and column configuration. Squeal is designed for a different task: to show the breadth of a database structure, not the depth. With Squeal one can see which tables were the last to update, which update the most often, which data is typical of each table, and other tasks to get a 'feeling' for the database.

Why on Earth might someone need such a silly tool?
--------------------------------------------------

Squeal is useful for developers new to an existing project to become acquainted with the database being used. We already have profiling tools for code, but nothing currently useful for large database examination.
